1) Difference between window object and document object
∙ Document object is any HTML document or web page  loaded in browser while window object
is a browser window or frame displaying webpage contents
∙ Document object is loaded inside the window after window is loaded first in the browser
∙ Document object contains tags, HTML element with attributes, while window object contains
objects, functions, and variables 
∙ Document object is a part of the BOM(browser object model) and DOM(document object model)
while  window object is a part of BOM, but not DOM
∙ Document is accessible from window using window.document while window is accessible from
window only using window.window
